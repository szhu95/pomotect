## Performance Improvements

- [ ] **Host own audio CDN for sounds page** - Replace SoundCloud iframe embeds with self-hosted audio files on a CDN to improve page efficiency and performance
  - Benefits: Faster page load, better control over player design, reduced iframe overhead
  - Current: Multiple SoundCloud iframes embedded on `/sounds` page
  - Target: Custom audio player with CDN-hosted files
