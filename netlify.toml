# Next.js already handles server-side rendering and static generation,
# so the Prerender extension is NOT needed. Just disable legacy prerendering.
#
# To disable legacy prerendering in Netlify dashboard:
# 1. Go to: Site settings → Build & deploy → Post processing → Prerendering
# 2. Disable "Enable legacy prerendering with Netlify"
# 3. Save changes
#
# The @netlify/plugin-nextjs plugin handles all Next.js rendering automatically.
